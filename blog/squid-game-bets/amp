    <p>The ratings of this series were so high, a huge amount of delight from viewers around the world, the South Korean series "Squid Game" about cruel children's survival games was recognized as the most popular in the history of Netflix. The series breaks all records and is very popular in social networks. It is also interesting that a South Korean Internet provider sued Netflix to pay for network and maintenance costs due to the huge traffic consumption.
    </p>
    <p>In just 10 days, the survival thriller took first place in 90 countries, becoming the first South Korean series to attract the attention of viewers from all over the world. In the 25 days since its premiere, it has been viewed 111 million times. The “Squid Game” is not only a cool series, but also a stunning surge in sales of Vans Slip-On sneakers in the classic "Triple White" coloring, whose sales have soared by 7800% since the premiere. These are the minimalistic sneakers worn by the players in this series.

</p>

    <p>In order for the drama "The Squid Game" to be seen by the audience, it took 13 years. Hwang Dong Hyuk started writing the first draft script of the series back in 2008. Then such a plot was new for South Korea, and the idea seemed non-commercial. As a result, "The Squid Game", which became perhaps the most successful Korean project on Netflix and the first Korean drama that gained worldwide popularity. The cinematographer admitted that writing the script and the production of the series itself caused him such stress that he lost six teeth.
    </p>
    <p>In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Hwang Dong-hyuk noted that, despite the open ending, the story of the main character Song Ki-hoon, in his opinion, is complete. But everyone who has already watched the first season of this series is already looking forward to continuing. And the main question is, will Hwang Dong Hyuk undertake to continue the series of children's games and provide the world with another masterpiece, or will he leave each of us to invent the ending in our head?
    </p>
    <p>And finally, some time ago, the creator shared that he still plans to start working on the script with experienced professionals. But he also noted that it's too early to talk about the release dates of the second season and the plot of "Squid Game". Now we have to count the days and wait for the official statement of the creator.

    <p>However, 1xBet experts have already made an official statement that they are taking various bets on the second season of the most popular series this fall. Now each of you has a chance to get rich just like the main character of Squid Games. However, you don't need to play children's games, just visit our website and share your thoughts about the continuation and place bets! Let's look at options:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>If you think that we will find out the fate of this series already this year, you can bet with a coefficient of 1.65 that the Netflix streaming system will please us with this news in 2021. But if you are convinced that we should not expect a statement this year, then your coefficient is 2.1. Of course, we all believe that we will have time to hear the long-awaited news before the New Year. And it's not surprising that after such a success, fans are looking forward to the announcement of the second season. But Netflix can leave us without a Christmas present.  The main thing is to have time to place a bet and present yourself with a New Year's gift together with 1XBET.
        </li>
        <li>As for children's games, you can also share your guess about the key game Green Light, Red Light. Well, let’s wonder if the heroes will still continue to pass the Doll's test and try to cross the line with the right steps. More than 38 million new videos related to this game have appeared in Tik Tok. Will it also be so relevant next season? If you know the answer to this question, then you place your bet with a coefficient of - 4.
        </li>
        <li>The betting company also has special bets about the heroes of this series. Let's think about whether everyone's favorite Seong Gi-hun will take part next season. After all, he clearly captured the hearts of fans and viewers who are all interested in learning about his future life and relationships with people. You can definitely say with a coefficient of 1.9 that the Seong Gi-hun will still appear in the sequel of the show.
        </li>
        <li>There are various fan theories around Seong and 1xBet is ready to reward them too. For example, the main character may appear in front of us in a new image of a warden (after all, red hair is clearly hinted at in the last episode) with a chance of 6. Or if he still decides to go over to the side of evil and takes the place of the main Front Man - odds of 16!  Or will he continue his stubborn struggle with the creators of children's violent games?
        </li>
    </ul>
