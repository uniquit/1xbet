    <h2>Is it real to make money in betting?</h2>
</div>
<div class="callout">
    <p>It‚Äôs real if you don‚Äôt think of it as entertainment, but as a full-fledged business, and choose the right bookie. It is important to calculate in advance how much you want to win. It is not necessary to set the bar very high, in business profit, 3-5% is considered very good. But greedy people in the former Soviet Union don't think so and want to make millions in two days. In betting, focus on low income, especially in the early stages.</p>
    <p>It is also necessary to decide in advance what you will do in case of a loss or a series of failures. Keep records, write down as much data as possible, make graphs (e.g., in Microsoft Excel), to clearly see your successes or failures. Be sure to write in the report <b>ROI</b>.</p>
</div>

<div class="heads brown">
    <h2>What‚Äôs the best bet for beginners to win?</h2>
</div>
<div class="callout">
    <p>Choose easy-to-understand types of bets in the initial stages. This can be a single bet, a double chance, and a total. Pay special attention to the total of auxiliary indicators (such as yellow cards or corners in soccer), because it is often the easiest to predict. See the average of the season and the last bouts. In tennis, the difference between the opponents says a lot - if one is stronger than the other, the game totals will be low. Over time, you will notice other patterns and learn more complex types of betting.</p>

<div class="heads green">
    <h2>The main thoughts to remember</h2>

        <li>Bookmaker's office 1x has a very wide line and proposition bets, so it is important to understand all the designations. At the initial stages, choose the simplest ones.</li>

        <li>Before you start betting, you must register, verify your identity (upload documents on the site), and fund your account. There are a lot of ways to get a win in this BM</li>
