                <p>The <a href="../default.htm" title="1xbet">1xBet bookmaker</a> is one of the most popular in the world. The bookmaker has a large selection of bets, many promotions, casinos and much more. But at the same time, this company is illegal in many countries (some have regional versions). Because of this, many users have problems accessing the site. To bypass blocking you need to use a mirror.</p>

            <div class="heads green">
                <h2>What is 1xBet mirror?</h2>
            </div>

            <div class="callout">

                <p>The 1xBet mirror is an exact copy of the bookmaker's portal. It's only difference is its different address. Each resource on the Internet has its own unique domain. You will not find the second such. This is logical. It is not possible for two sites to have the same address. Then one of them would not open, or other conflicts would appear.</p>
                <p>But not many people know that one resource can have two or even more addresses. Sites 1xbet-sport.in and www.1xbet-sport.in are already two links, one of which is a mirror. Every portal on the Internet has at least two addresses. And you can find some information through several links (mirrors) to the same source. In the admin panel, developers usually indicate the main address.
                </p>
<p class='center'>
                        <amp-img alt="1x mirror site" src="../images/screenshoots/1xbet-mirror.png"   width="220" height="500"></amp-img><br>
                    </p>

                <p>Thus, a 1xBet mirror is an alternative link to the same resource. The bookmaker xBet itself uses them quite often, for example, during technical work. Instead of completely shutting down the resource, the technical service puts the redirect to an alternate domain. The user does not notice anything and can continue to place bets.
                </p>
                <p>In the field of gambling, a site mirror is a way to bypass blocking. Here you need to understand how access is blocked in general. This is done by the ISP that provides you with the service. For example, in Russia there is a list of resources that need to be blocked. It is drawn up by Roskomnadzor. This government agency gives instructions to providers to which resources can be given access and which are not. But if you use an alternative link, which is not yet in the Roskomnadzor registers, then access will be open.
                </p>
                <p>There is only one problem. Such lists are constantly updated, so over time, mirrors that you can use at the moment get there. Roskomnadzor is monitoring this. Therefore, it is necessary to constantly receive new links. We will tell you how to do this below.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="heads blue">
                <h3>Why does a bookmaker need an alternative address for its operation?</h3>
            </div>

            <div class="callout">

                <p>Site mirrors are needed to provide the ability to access a site using multiple addresses. From a developer's point of view, the goals are as follows:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Protection against crashes, damage and even hacker attacks. This happens quite often. The situation is standard - the developers introduce some changes, make new code or add plugins, but something goes wrong - because of which the entire portal “crashes”. And hacker attacks should not be ruled out - after all, the bookmaker is large, and anything can happen.</li>
                    <li>Use of alternative links during technical work. Smart developers usually set up a mirror redirect when they implement the above changes. Yes, the 1xBet resource does not look bad anyway, but still, sometimes something should be added there. And users during work will be able to safely use the current 1xBet mirror.</li>
                    <li>Fraud protection, as well as many other purposes.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Anyway, 1xBet mirror is a very useful thing. Therefore, its existence is more than justified. From the bettor's point of view, the raison d'être of alternative addresses is also huge. You know that you can always go to the portal and place a bet. No technical work, hacker attacks and the like are not scary for you.
                </p>

                <p>The fastest way is to follow the link from our website. It is updated as quickly as possible. Sometimes it is even faster than it will be provided to you on the official website, because we work directly with the bookmaker and we are given links as a matter of priority.
                </p>

            </p>
            


                <p>You can also ask the support service for a mirror of the site for today. It is safe, because if you just search for links on the Internet, you can get a virus, be subjected to a phishing attack and lose your personal data. We will return to this later. You can contact support for help in the following ways:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Call <b>000 800 919-02-66</b> or <b>000 800 919-10-72</b> for customers from India. Explain the situation, employees will tell you what to do next.</li>
                    <li>Email info@1xbet.com or support@1xbet.com (the first address is for general questions, the second is for technical support). In a response letter, operators are very willing to send links with mirrors.</li>
                    <li>You can also use the chat on the official website of another 1xBet version. For example, you cannot go to the international version, instead, open the Ukrainian version and write to the chat (it is located at the bottom right on any page) that you have a problem with access and you cannot place a bet. There is always an operator who will tell you what to do next.</li>
                </ol>

                    </p>


                <p>In order to avoid problems, it is better to take care of permanent access for sports betting in advance. You can always have an xBet mirror if you download one of four programs:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>xWin is a standalone program that has a slightly different interface than the web portal, but it is also easy to understand. The functionality is the same as on a regular portal. But the software can automatically find 1xBet mirrors that can be used if the main address is not available. The user won't even notice it.</li>
                    <li>1xBrowser is a full-fledged browser that only opens 1xBet. There, too, automatic connection to alternative links is performed. 1xWin and xBrowser can be found at the top left of the 1xBet site (a button in the form of a monitor).</li>
                    <li>Access. This software simply displays the current working mirror of the bookmaker's official resource. It is downloaded in the "Bypass locks" section (the button in the form of a lock at the top left).</li>
                    <li>Use a smartphone / tablet app. The mobile version also automatically searches for a suitable resource and connects to it. Downloading the <a href="../app" title="app 1xbet">application</a> is very simple - using the xBet website opened on a mobile device. Open the "Mobile Applications" page (located at the very bottom of the page). There you will find the link you need to the program for Android or iOS.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Dangers of alternative addresses</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="callout">
                <p>It is quite easy for a good developer to make a copy of a bookmaker's resource. You don't need to have extensive programming knowledge to do this. Many cybercriminals use this to gain access to your account and money on it.</p>

                <p><b>Attention! Our site works directly with the bookmaker, so the links that we provide are always safe!</b></p>

                <p>Everything happens as follows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The client goes to a fake link that he found on the Internet.</li>
                    <li>He enters his username and password there. Since the resource is not real, this data is passed on to the attackers.</li>
                    <li>They go to a real resource and withdraw all the money that is in your account.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>In most cases, after an attempt to log in, nothing happens at all, since the attackers copied only the first page of the office's resource. And they did not take everything else, including the personal account. In order not to become a victim of a phishing attack, you need to use the links provided by the bookmaker itself, or the resources that cooperate with it. Usually they connect 1xBrowser or Access to their functionality. Thanks to this, the players actually get the same address that the bookmaker gives.</p>

                <h3>Alternative portal authorization</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="callout">
                <p>The peculiarity of all mirrors is that they are connected to the same server. This means the following:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>One account will function both on the main portal and on the alternative. You can enter both there and there using the same username and password. You will see the same personal account in front of you and will be able to dispose of your funds.</li>
                    <li><b>The money won't go anywhere. This information is stored on the server.</b></li>
                    <li>The betting line of each event will be the same for all links. The same goes for promotions and other pages. If something changes on the main link, the same will happen on all the others, and without a time delay. When a client places a bet on one portal, it also affects others.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>From the user's point of view, the use of alternative addresses looks quite simple - you open a different URL, a different link, and the appearance of the portal is exactly the same as that of 1xBet. These alternative addresses are developed by the bookmaker's employees. Therefore, you can log in using the username and password that you usually use.</p>

            </div>

            <div class="heads green">
                <h2>What can I do without alternative addresses?</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="callout">
                <p>You can use one of these methods:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Proxy server. You can find a free address on the Internet or buy it (in this case, it will only be yours, and no one else will use this address). Give preference to those servers that support SSL, as the bookmaker uses the https protocol. A simpler option is to install an extension in the browser that will automatically connect to servers in the country selected by the user. There are many such extensions today.</li>
                    <li>VPN service. You can install a free or paid browser add-on. Opera already has a built-in VPN. You just need to turn it on using the button at the top left. But it is better to download the browser from its official resource on the Internet. Otherwise, you might end up with an outdated or even fraudulent version. Of course, in this case, the likelihood of becoming a victim of a phishing attack is much lower than when searching for alternative bookmaker links, but there is still a danger.</li>
                    <li>TOR browser. The program was developed by order of the US government to bypass any blocking on the Internet, then came into the public domain. It uses a combination of proxy and VPN. To date, the program is distributed completely free of charge.</li>
                    <li>Anonymizer. These sites hide the real IP of the visitor and give him the opportunity to bypass the blocking. Just enter the address in the anonymizer line.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Each of these methods has its own advantages and disadvantages. For example, free proxy servers are fast, but unstable. That is, now the BC portal can open, and after a while this opportunity will disappear. Paid proxies are fast and stable, but some people simply cannot afford to buy them.
                <p>VPN is more stable, but slower. Again, the best solution would be to buy a paid browser extension, but not everyone will agree to pay money for it. The disadvantage of TOR also is that it is rather slow. But you will get 100% access to the blocked resource, which other methods cannot guarantee. The anonymizer is unstable and works slowly. So it's best to download Access in advance or use an app for your smartphone, tablet, or computer.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="callout">
                <p>The bookmaker is blocked in different countries due to its illegal status. In Russia, for example, Roskomnadzor is responsible for this. This government agency constantly updates the list of prohibited resources.</p>

                <p>The developers of the 1xBet site themselves use alternative addresses during technical work or failures. They provide a working mirror for users who encounter blockages.</p>

                <p>Instead of alternative addresses, you can use a program for a computer, a mobile application, proxy, VPN, TOR and anonymizer.</p>
