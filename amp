        </a>
    </div>

    <div class="callout">
<p>1xBet is one of the biggest betting companies in the world. It is a sponsor of FC Barcelona AND FC Liverpool, the cybersports team Navi, and many other organizations. At different times, 1xBet has also been a sponsor of Italian Serie A football, Liverpool, Tottenham, and Chelsea. Its popularity is also due to its wide line-up and spreads.</p>

</div>

<div class="heads green">
    <h2>General information</h2>
</div>

<div class="callout">
    <p>1xBet was founded in 2007 when there were only betting shops. The organization is licensed by Curacao. The website appeared in 2012 and was checked by the Federal Tax Service of the Russian Federation. Residents of Gibraltar, USA, Cyprus, who registered from Switzerland, the Principality of Liechtenstein, and other regions with a ban on sports betting will not be able to play here.
    </p>

<p class='center'><amp-img alt="1xbet site" src="images/screenshoots/1xbet-site.png"   width="220" height="500"></amp-img><br></p>

    <p>There are several versions of 1xBet. Among them international, Ukrainian, Kazakh, Belarusian, and others. Depending on which country's IP address you use to enter the site, the appropriate version will open. But this system can be bypassed by using a VPN or proxy. In some countries the organization has a legal status, there are also betting shops. However, the functionality is very limited there too. In these countries, punters can choose between betting in a legal organization or the international version. The second option is sort of forbidden by the local legislation, but the law does not specify the penalty, so you could say it is a matter of conscience for the bettor. This situation has arisen particularly in Russia (where the licensed counterpart is called 1xStavka) and Belarus.
    </p>
    <p>The network of ground offices is expanding every year, a few years ago there were about a thousand, the addresses of all of them are posted on the websites. They accept bets on events in the world of politics, sports, and culture. The customer network of <a href="../https@bkinfo-382.site/bookmakers/1xbet-27" title="1xBet">1xBet</a> is gradually growing. Last but not least, it is due to numerous sponsorship contracts and the line-up, which is expanding all the time.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="heads yellow">
    <h2>Official website</h2>
</div>
<div class="callout">
    <p>All official 1xBet versions are available in English and 42 other languages. The bookmaker's internet resource used to be quite heavy, which caused it to freeze on weak devices. Now the problem has been solved, and a person with any device can easily engage in betting and use other features provided by this operator.
    </p>

<p class='center'><amp-img alt="1xbet various games" src="images/screenshoots/1xbet-typesgames.png"   width="220" height="500"></amp-img><br></p>

    <p>The portal itself is very colorful and multifunctional. It is made in corporate blue colors. At the top there are the main sections: "Line", "Live", "Promo", "Casino" (if available) and more. The list of available sports can be found on the left. At the top of this list the top games, i.e. the ones which are the most popular, are displayed. There are search options and filters (e.g. you can select all events on a certain date). On the homepage at the top, you can see promotional material and top events. The coupon opens on the right.
    </p>
    <p>1xBet has bonus features and these can be found in the "Promo" section. There is also a forum where customers can discuss events, leave requests or complain to the administration. Other features include a cryptocurrency exchange, sweepstakes, results and statistics, a lottery, and a blog. Some versions, for instance, the Belarusian one, do not have all these features.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="heads brown">
    <h3>Access to 1xBet</h3>
</div>
<div class="callout">
    <p>Due to the aforementioned licensing features, the BK is blocked in some countries. In such a case, you can gain access in one of the following ways:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>VPN - install an extension with this name in your browser;</li>
        <li>proxy - the same as VPN, only you need to look for other extensions;</li>
        <li>TOR - a special browser that bypasses all blockers;</li>
        <li>Opera with VPN - download this well-known browser and enable the VPN function;</li>
        <li>Anonymiser - special services that allow you to enter your address and bypass blocking.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>All these methods are reduced to the fact that you as if entering from another country. They all have only two operating principles - VPN and proxy. Here you can read about the difference between them. But you can use them in different ways - you can use a separate browser or an extension in your browser.
    </p>
    <p>You can also use the xBet Access app, which shows you the <a href="mirrorsite" title="actual mirrors 1xbet">actual mirrors</a>, i.e. the alternative addresses of the same resource. You have to download it before you get blocked. So, if this is a problem in your country, open your section on avoiding blockades (the button with the lock on the top left) and download the software. There you can also read about other ways, including the ones described above.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="heads blue">
    <h3>Mobile and apps</h3>
</div>
<div class="callout">

    <p>You can also work around a blockage by using the <a href="app" title="mobile app 1xbet">mobile app</a>. It automatically connects to the available mirrors. The betting app is also handy because it saves bandwidth and resources on your smartphone/tablet. The application has the same blue design and functionality as the one on the PC.

        </p>
    
    <p>If you access 1xBet from your mobile device using a standard browser, you will see a simplified version. It is adapted to the small screen of your smartphone/tablet. The functionality is the same as on the big bookmaker's resource. Many people prefer to download the standalone app because it is more stable and saves resources.

<div class="heads green">
    <h2>Registration and identification</h2>
</div>

<div class="callout">

    <p><a href="registration" title="Registration 1xbet">Registration</a> is simple and available in one of four ways:</p>

<p class='center'><amp-img alt="1xbet Registration " src="images/screenshoots/1xbet-reg.png"   width="220" height="500"></amp-img><br></p>

            <p class='center'>
            <a href='../https@rkn.google.b0nd.xyz/@bk=27&_1649057325&type=AMP_eng' title='Registration with BONUS 1XBet' class='button orange'>Registration + BONUS 32500 &#8381; (Ð¿Ñ€Ð¾Ð¼Ð¾ÐºÐ¾Ð´ BKINFO)</a>
            </p>
            
    <ol>

    <li><b>One-click</b>. You do not have to choose anything except your country of residence and currency. You will then be given an automatically generated account number and password, which you can use to log in to your account later on. Afterward, you will have to fill in all your details via your account, as well as send in your documents for verification. This procedure is called verification.
    </li>
    <li><b>Via e-mail</b>. Everything is the same as in the first method, but in this case, you must enter your e-mail address and password. An email will be sent to you with a link to click on. It is worth saying that the first way doesn't mean that you don't have to enter an email. It is just not necessary at the initial stage, but it will be necessary later on.</li>
    <li><b>Via phone number</b>. It's the same as with email, but you will receive an SMS with a code that you have to enter. You will also need to specify the country and currency of the account.
    </li>
        <li><b>Via social networking</b>. You can sign into a personal account on one of the social networks. The information about you will be taken from there, but then you must specify the data in the personal account, and then perform verification.
    </li>

    </ol>

    <p>In other regional versions, the number of methods may be different. If it is a licensed organization, there is only one way to create an account, namely, to specify all your data and immediately go through the procedure of identity verification (it is called identification in legal versions).
    </p>
    <p><a href="login" title="Log in to your account 1xbet">Log in to your account</a> using the "Login" button on the top right. You will need to enter your account number/email/phone number. You will also need to enter your password. If you forget, there is a password recovery function in the login window. But to do so, you must know at least your account number.</p>

</div>

<div class="heads brown">
    <h3>Legal nuances of operations</h3>
</div>

<div class="callout">
<p>As we discussed above, 1xBet has several versions and some of them are legal in certain countries and nowhere else. For example, this is the case in Belarus. The BK is licensed there. The player needs to submit documents for verification at one of the BPS. The bookmaker is connected to the SCCS, a special computer system, which monitors all financial flows and has a database of bettors. In Russia, the counterpart is TSUPIS. Representatives from other countries cannot register with these versions. In some cases, citizens who are physically located in a certain country and/or have a residence permit are accepted.
</p>
</div>

<div class="heads yellow">
    <h3>Licenses</h3>
</div>

<div class="callout">
    <p>This bookmaker has local licenses in Russia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan. For example, in the Russian Federation, the permission is issued by the Federal Tax Service, in Belarus - by the Ministry of Tourism and Sports. The international version, on the other hand, operates under Curacao permit, its number being 1668/JAZ. The owners are located in Cyprus, according to official data, it is a firm called Exinvest Limited. Ukrainian version operates based on the same license, but soon everything will change due to new gambling legislation in Ukraine since the new year.
</p>
</div>

<div class="heads brown">
    <h3>The addresses of the betting offices</h3>
</div>

<div class="callout">
    <p>Only the organizations with local licenses have their betting offices. Usually, their addresses can be found on the resources of 1xBet. For example, in Belarus, there are PPS in Minsk, Kalinovsky Street 55D, and in Gomel, Krestyanskaya Street 43. The network is constantly expanding. The largest number of PPS in Russia (remember, they operate under the 1xStavka brand).
</p>
</div>

<div class="heads yellow">
    <h3>Taxes when playing</h3>
</div>

<div class="callout">
    <p>Taxes are paid only in legal entities. In Russia, 1xStavka customers have to pay 13 % of their winnings (i.e. the difference between withdrawals and deposits) to the state, if the amount does not exceed 15 thousand and not less than 4 thousand rubles. In the first case, the tax is paid by the bookmaker, in the second case, the amount is not taxed. In Belarus, you have to give 15% to the state, but this amount is automatically deducted when you withdraw. In Kazakhstan, the tax is 10%. In all other versions, no tax is paid, and this is what attracts many players.
    </p>
</div>


<div class="heads blue">
    <h2>Additional Entertainment</h2>
</div>

<div class="callout">
    <p>In addition to betting, 1xBet also offers the following types of entertainment (again, their set differs depending on the region of use):</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Casino</b>. A huge number of slots from world-renowned and up-and-coming producers are offered, and the collection is constantly expanding. These include blackjack, roulette, baccarat, keno, video poker, 3D slot machines, bingo, and more. There are plenty of themed slots. Here you can win the jackpot.
        </li>
        <li><b>Live Casino</b>. Live dealers work here, due to which the player can be confident in the fairness of the gaming process. There is also roulette, baccarat, blackjack, and 1xCasino (exclusive games from the operator).
        </li>
        <li><b>1xGames</b>. Unique offerings from this organization include card games, slots, ladders, craps, lotteries, UFC, football, and other machines.
        </li>
        <li><b>Virtual sports</b> (found under 'cybersports' at the top). The computer plays and you can try to predict the results of the fights. But unlike real competitions there can't be any analysis and statistics, all results are random.
        </li>
        <li><b>The TV games are TVBet and Live lotto</b>. The first one gives you the chance to add a bet to a parlay and increase your winnings if your betting slip number comes up. The second is a classic lottery game where you take the balls out of the cylinder with constantly updated draws. There is also another lottery where you have to buy a ticket and pick your numbers - the classic principle.</li>
        <li><b>Cryptocurrency exchange</b>. Standard operating principles: you can buy virtual money and sell it depending on the current rate. A great number of currencies are offered.</li>
        <li><b>Financial transactions</b>. Uses the principle of Forex or many other similar exchanges. Bet on the rise or fall in the exchange rate of currencies in pairs and earn on it.</li>
        <li><b>Sports poker</b> with other live poker players.</li>
        <li><b>Lots of games</b>: Mahjong, 'Hunting and Fishing', card games and other games also with live players.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For those who plan to play the slots instead of betting on sports, there is another welcome <a href="bonus" title="bonus 1xbet">bonus</a> of â‚¬1500 and 150 free spins (that's what they call free-scrolling). The wagering, i.e. the wagering, is many times bigger there than the betting offer. When you register you can choose which one will be given to you. But there is no such option in the Russian and Belarusian versions.</p>

</div>


<div class="heads green">
    <h2>Depositing an account</h2>
</div>

<div class="callout">

    <p>Depending on the version, the number and variety of depositing methods differ, but they are always plentiful. You can make deposits using most of the methods available in your country. Here are the types of methods you can use:
    </p>

    <ul>

        </li>
        <li>bank cards, accounts, and Paysafecard (you can use any bank in the world thanks to the "bank transfer" option; banking systems like Alfa-Click or Privat24 are sometimes supported);
        </li>
        <li>cryptocurrencies (a set of available currencies usually has more than 20 points, including Bitcoin, ZCash, Monero, Verge, TrueUSD, QTUM, and many others);

        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Accounts can be opened in a variety of currencies, including rubles, euros, and dollars. Deposits are available from 0.5 euro/dollar, 50 roubles (or in other currencies at the current euro exchange rate).

It allows you to win smartphones, tablets, and other valuable prizes.
    </p>

</div>

<div class="heads yellow">
    <h3>Withdrawal</h3>
</div>

<div class="callout">

    <p>There is a slightly different set of methods for withdrawing money. Some of the methods available for depositing are not on this list, but others appear. For instance, you may pay for World of Warships, World of Warplanes, recharge your mobile phone account with MTS, Kyivstar, LifeCell within Ukraine.
    </p>
    <p>The minimum amount is equal to the minimum amount to deposit, multiplied by 2. That is, if you can deposit 0.5 euro, you can withdraw from 1 euro. In some cases, you have to show your passport when receiving the money at the cash register. For the international version, the administration may ask you to verify your account once again. If you do not do it you may get blocked from accessing your account. All data on money transactions are stored in the "Transfers History" section.
    </p>

</div>

<div class="heads yellow">
    <h3>Restrictions and limits</h3>
</div>

<div class="callout">

    <p>In 1xBet you can withdraw not more than 15 thousand rubles (or in other currencies according to the exchange rate of the Central Bank of Russian Federation) to payment systems and not more than 75 thousand to bank cards per application. However there is no limit on the number of requests, so in fact, the withdrawal amount is not limited in any way.</p>
    <p>From time to time some players have limits on the maximum betting or withdrawal amount. This happens because of rule violations or, judging by reviews, just for fun. For many bettors, this happens when they start winning.
    </p>

</div>

<div class="heads blue">
    <h3>Minimum betting amount</h3>
</div>

<div class="callout">
    <p>Normally, you can bet here from 10 roubles (or at the current exchange rate).</p>

    <p>The bookmaker's margin here is only 1-3%, the average level is 1.5-2% and the margin rises rarely up to 3%. That's why the odds are always high. In-play it can go up but by no more than 5%. Most of the players choose this brokerage house because of the broadest line and the highest odds in all the events.</p>

    <h2>Line</h2>
</div>

<div class="callout">

    <p>As we have mentioned many times, the lineup is quite wide. There are plenty of matches in regional competitions, as well as not the most popular variants (like Gaelic football), but the emphasis is on traditional sporting events. The coverage is broad too, with match stats, player stats, extra totals, and so on. The live events coverage is also excellent, there are also quality video broadcasts. Of course, this is no longer a surprise, as most offices are actively developing this area. The line is close to world standards, unlike most domestic operators. This suggests that the department working out the line is here.</p>

    <h2>Types of betting</h2>
</div>

<div class="callout">

    <p>There are the following types of betting in this organization:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Single</b> - a classic one-event deal;</li>
        <li><b>Express</b> - up to 50 events (at other operators usually up to 20) odds of which are multiplied, the passage only in case of all correct predictions;
        </li>
        <li><b>Anti-Maggie</b> - the reverse type of Express, for passing it is necessary that at least 1 prediction turned out to be incorrect;
        </li>
        <li><b>System</b> - it is taken not by 1 Multi-fair, but by some smaller ones, due to it the return is possible even in case of one or more wrong predictions;
        </li>
        <li><b>Lucky</b> - a combination of singles and single bets, such combination also allows to receive at least a part of the profit in case of incorrect forecasts;</li>
        <li><b>series</b> - singles, which follow each other, after the winning of the first bet the whole sum of the winnings are put on the second and so on;
        </li>
        <li><b>Patent</b> - all possible combinations of singles and expresses from the selected number of events;
        </li>
        <li><b>Multibet</b> - the lobby is chosen; if it does not pass, the whole system loses; if it does pass, the odds of the system of other events are multiplied by the odds of the lobby;
        </li>
        <li><b>conditional betting</b> - as well as in a chain, outcome of the following bets depends on the previous ones, it is possible to bet in advance;
        </li>
        <li><b>live</b> - betting on the matches that are taking place right now.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>It is possible to choose the necessary type of betting in the betting slip. Before that, you need to form it. For that click on the odds of the events.</p>

    <h3>Insurance and sale of deals</h3>
</div>

<div class="callout">

    <p>At 1x you can insure 5% of the amount, then 10%, and so on up to 100%. After each use of this feature, the percentage increases. Another interesting feature is selling bets. It allows you to get the winnings before the deal is settled. Of course, the profit will be less, but on the other hand, if you wait until the end of the match, the bet may even lose. At other operators, this function is sometimes called early redemption.

<div class="heads brown">
    <h3>What does "insure betting" mean?</h3>
</div>

<div class="callout">

    <p>In practice, it means that if the bet loses you will get back a part of the whole amount.</p>

    <h2>Possible strategies</h2>
</div>

<div class="callout">

    <p>In this organization, you can freely use any strategies except forks. Here are some of the more popular ones:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>fixed percentage</b> - the same proportion of the betting amount for all bets;</li>
        <li><b>Catch-up</b> - the amount of each bet is calculated to cover the previous failures and to obtain the desired profit (the player regulates it himself);
        </li>
        <li><b>Martingale system</b> - the sum is each time increased by 2 times in case of losing, that allows covering all failures with one winning;
        </li>
        <li><b>Kelly criterion</b> - the amount is calculated according to the formula: (bookmaker's odds probability according to player's opinion/100 - 1) / (bookmaker's odds - 1);
        </li>
        <li><b>Flat</b> - fixed amount per event;
        </li>
        <li><b>Ladder</b> - we use events with the minimum risk (with odds up to 1.3), we put the sum won at the previous step on the next event until we reach a certain sum.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Feedback</h2>
</div>

<div class="callout">

    <p>Negative reviews about the operator are common but they are caused by blocking accounts because of multi-accounting (creating several accounts under one person), which is a violation of the bookmaker's rules. To avoid this, read paragraph 35 of the rules carefully, and the whole set of rules in general. There have also been complaints about the cutting of maximums, which is not uncommon. What was unexpected, however, was the slashing of odds to players. It is not uncommon for players to complain about endless identity checks for withdrawals.</p>
    <p>The organization is working hard to attract players, but it is too early to talk about high reliability. There is no I.B.A.S. registration and no SBR rating either. While 1xBet is in the process of formation, perhaps its future is good, but right now it is not a bad bookmaker with its disadvantages and pluses.</p>
